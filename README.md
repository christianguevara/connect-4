# Connect 4

This project implements a classic Connect 4 game in JavaScript. It was created as a practice resource for coding interviews, demonstrating common programming concepts and problem-solving approaches.

This is not the ideal solution, but it is not the worst either x)

## Purpose

This implementation serves as:  
- A coding exercise for interview preparation  
- A demonstration of game logic implementation  
- Practice with 2D array manipulation  
- An example of input validation and game state management  

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed or a similar JavaScript runtime.  
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.  
3. Navigate to the project directory.  
4. Run the game using: `node connect4.mjs`
